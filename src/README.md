# Credits and Mentions

In addition to the resources mentioned in the original README.md, here are some other sources I found especially useful while working on this project (particularly for the Boids Algorithm):

Timm Wong (2008): A great introduction to the Boids Algorithm
https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2008-09/modeling-natural-systems/boids.html

Sebastian Lague (2019): This video helped me understand what was expected from my simulation

Conrad Parker (2007): My favorite reference â€” I actually went ahead and implemented this pseudocode logic in task3
https://vergenet.net/~conrad/boids/pseudocode.html

Special thanks to Archisman Das for helping out whenever I faced any sort of task related trouble.
