TASK1 : TURTLESIM INTRODUCTION 
This task was about running the `turtlesim` package in ROS2 and controlling the turtle using the `turtle_teleop_key` node. I was trying to make a "symbol" but it didnt have accurate angles intially and then i decided to use teleport relative node to create the symbol. But then this Archisman guy decided that I have to do it by the inefficient way, which i did in the end. 

Here's a yt link of me doing it
