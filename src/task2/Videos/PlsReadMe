I am sorry i was nott able to complete task 2 within docker. I spent 10+hourse trying to get it to recognize the packages used in my code but it refused.I already had ros2 installed on a server i have so i have completed the project with a video attached as well. Im aware i might lose points for not doing it with docker but i just want to see I am extremely passionate and driven and committed to joining this club. I hope that you see that I still have the skills to join this distinguished club.
