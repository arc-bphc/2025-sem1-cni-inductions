Pseudocode: for swarming of turtles

    • spawn turts
    • make space have coordinates
    • give turtles some random initial velocity
    • t1=turtle.1
      




1)Seperation():
    • #tx tells which turtle it is
    • While tx for ty < 1cm	:	#this way I can see if there are any turtles near tx within a 					radius of 4cm. If they exist ill push them away
        ◦ push ty and tx away from each other with some velocity vector(maybe)
        ◦ 


2)alignment(): 			#move is same dir as neighbours
    • see how many turtles are near tx in a radius of 6cm
    • see alignment of turtles in 4cm with variation of 15 degrees
    • if see new group of turtles with more turtles than initial group with new alignment with variation more than 15 degrees, then adjust own direction to be same as new group closest turtle



3)Cohesion(): 				#move toward avg position of neighbours
    • turtles in 3 cm radius are considered own group			#might need to change 									values for radius
    • let a = avg of the other turtles’ position
      
    • make turtles swarm point a
