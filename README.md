## Task 1: Getting Started with Turtlesim

In this exercise, you will:

* Run a ROS 2 container with Docker.
* Access a Linux desktop in your browser using noVNC.
* Launch the turtlesim simulator.
* Control the turtle using your keyboard.

The goal is not only to make the turtle move but also to get familiar with the tools we use: **Git, Docker, Docker Compose, ROS 2, and the Linux terminal**.

---

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Git**

   * [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

2. **Install Docker**

   * [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

3. **Install Docker Compose**

   * [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

4. **Learn the Basics of the Terminal**

   * [Linux Command Line Basics](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)

---
### Steps

#### 1.1. Fork this repository. 

**[DO NOT PULL OR MAKE CHANGES ON THIS REPO]**

#### 1.2. Clone the Repository. 

**[Make sure that you are cloning your own fork and not this repo.]**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

#### 2. Start the Containers

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This will:

* Build the ROS 2 Humble container with turtlesim installed.
* Start the noVNC container (desktop accessible in browser).

#### 3. Open the noVNC Desktop

Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

You should see a Linux desktop inside your browser.

#### 4. Open an Interactive Shell in the ROS 2 Container

```bash
docker compose exec ros2 /bin/bash
```

You are now inside the container.

#### 5. Run Turtlesim

```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

The turtle window should appear in your noVNC browser desktop.

#### 6. Control the Turtle

On your **host machine**, open another terminal and again enter the container:

```bash
docker compose exec ros2 /bin/bash
```

Then run:

```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
```

You can now move the turtle with your keyboard.

---

### Deliverable

* Draw a simple shape (circle or square) using your keyboard.
* Take a screenshot of your running turtlesim window in noVNC.
* Place the screenshot in:

  ```
  src/task1
  ```
* Submit via a **Pull Request** as explained in [How to Submit Your Work](#how-to-submit-your-work).

---

### Troubleshooting

1. **No turtle window in noVNC**

   * Ensure you launched turtlesim *inside the container*.
   * Check you are on `http://localhost:8080`.

2. **`exec: "ros2": executable file not found`**

   * Ensure you ran:

     ```bash
     docker compose exec ros2 /bin/bash
     ```

3. **"no such service" error with `docker compose exec`**

   * Check containers with:

     ```bash
     docker compose ps
     ```
   * Restart if needed:

     ```bash
     docker compose up -d
     ```

4. **Teleop not working**

   * Ensure the terminal running `teleop_twist_keyboard` is active.

## Task 2: Writing Your First ROS 2 Node

In this task, you will learn how **ROS 2 topics, nodes, and messages** work by writing your own ROS 2 node to control the turtle.
You will move beyond teleoperation and instead write code that makes the turtle **trace out shapes automatically**.

---

### Objectives

1. Understand the basics of **ROS 2 nodes, topics, and messages**.
2. Create a new **ROS 2 workspace** dedicated for this task.
3. Write a ROS 2 Python node to:

   * Generate a list of points on a **circle**.
   * Move the turtle through these points, tracing out the circle.
   * **BONUS:** Modify your code to draw **a different shape** of your choice.

---

### Steps

#### 1. Open a Shell in the ROS 2 Container

```bash
docker compose exec ros2 /bin/bash
```

#### 2. Create a New Workspace

Inside the `/src` folder, create a new workspace for Task 2:

```bash
cd /src
mkdir -p task2
cd task2
colcon build
```
You need to run this again to use your custom pkg
```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

#### 3. Create a New Package

Weâ€™ll use Python for simplicity.

```bash
cd /src/task2
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python turtle_draw --dependencies rclpy geometry_msgs
```

This will create a new package called `turtle_draw` with Python dependencies.

---

### 4. Helpful Resources

Before you start coding, read these short tutorials:

* [ROS 2 Concepts: Nodes, Topics, Messages](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools.html)
* [Writing a Publisher and Subscriber (Python)](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html)
* [geometry\_msgs/Twist Message](https://docs.ros.org/en/crystal/Tutorials/Topics/Understanding-ROS2-Topics.html#ros2-interface-show)

---

### 5. Your Task

Inside the `turtle_draw` package:

1. Create a Python node file:

   ```bash
   cd /src/task2/turtle_draw/turtle_draw
   touch circle_drawer.py
   chmod +x circle_drawer.py
   ```

2. Write code that does the following:

   * Generate a list of points on a circle using the equations:

     ```
     x = r * cos(theta)
     y = r * sin(theta)
     ```

   * Move the turtle from one point to the next by publishing velocity commands to the `/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic.

3. Add an entry point in `setup.py` so you can run it using:

   ```bash
   ros2 run turtle_draw circle_drawer
   ```

	**NOTE: Make sure to check out /src/example-submission for guidance on how to setup entrypoints and structure your code!**

	 NOTE: You will need to run `colcon build` and `source install/setup.bash` again to make sure you are running the latest version of your node.

	 NOTE: Make sure that turtlesim_node is running before running your node.

---

### 6. BONUS Challenge

Modify your code to draw **any other shape** (square, spiral, star, etc.) by changing your point generation function.

---

### Deliverables

* Push your workspace inside:

  ```
  src/task2
  ```

  (only include your package, not build/install/logs folders).

* Add screenshots of your turtle drawing shapes in noVNC.

* If you want to submit a video you can upload it to YouTube, and add a link to it as a comment on your pull request.

* Submit via a **Pull Request** as described in [How to Submit Your Work](#how-to-submit-your-work).

---

### Troubleshooting

1. **Cannot edit files created by ros2 pkg create**

   * Ensure you are on your host computer.
   * Run `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER src/task2` in the root directory to change the ownership of the created files.

2. **`Package 'turtle_draw' not found`**

   * Ensure you ran:

     ```bash
	 colcon build
	 source install/setup.bash
     ```

## Task 3: Swarm Algorithm with Turtlesim

### Objective

In this task, you are required to implement a **swarm behavior** using at least **five turtles** in the `turtlesim` simulator.
This is a slightly open-ended task designed to encourage creativity and experimentation.

One well-known algorithm for simulating swarm behavior is the **Boids algorithm**, which models the flocking behavior of birds. You can read more about it here:
ðŸ”— [Boids â€” Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids)

---

### Requirements

1. **Spawn at least 5 turtles** inside `turtlesim`.

   * Use the `/spawn` service to create multiple turtles.
   * Each turtle should move independently according to your algorithm.

2. **Implement a swarm algorithm** where turtles show some form of coordinated movement.

   * Examples of behaviors: flocking, chasing a leader, forming patterns, or avoiding collisions.
   * Boids is strongly suggested, but other creative approaches are welcome.

3. **Use ROS 2 nodes and topics** to control the turtles.

   * Publish velocity commands to `/turtleX/cmd_vel`.
   * Optionally, subscribe to `/turtleX/pose` for position feedback.

---

### Deliverables

* **Code**: Submit your ROS 2 package containing the implementation.
* **Demonstration Video**: Upload a short demo (1â€“3 minutes) of your turtles executing the swarm algorithm.

  * Upload as an **unlisted YouTube video** and include the link in your submission.

---

### Suggested Approach

1. Research the **Boids algorithm** and its three rules:

   * **Separation**: avoid crowding neighbors.
   * **Alignment**: move in the same direction as neighbors.
   * **Cohesion**: move toward the average position of neighbors.
2. Start by spawning 5 turtles in random positions.
3. Implement each rule step by step and test.
4. Tune parameters (speed, turning rate, neighbor distance) until the behavior looks realistic.
